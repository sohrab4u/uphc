        "Answer:\n",
        "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of neural network designed for processing structured grid-like data, such as images. It uses convolutional layers to extract features (e.g., edges, textures) through filters, followed by pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions while preserving important information. This makes CNNs highly effective for image-related tasks.\n",
        "Differences from traditional fully connected neural networks (FCNNs):\n",
        "•\n",
        "Architecture: CNNs have convolutional and pooling layers, which focus on local patterns and reduce parameters, while FCNNs connect every neuron across layers, leading to more parameters.\n",
        "•\n",
        "Performance on image data: CNNs are more efficient and accurate for images due to their ability to learn hierarchical features (e.g., edges to objects) and handle spatial relationships, whereas FCNNs struggle with high-dimensional image data due to computational complexity and overfitting risks."

        "LeNet-5 Architecture: LeNet-5, introduced by Yann LeCun et al. in 1989, is a pioneering Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of seven layers:\n",

Its architecture inspired models like AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, enabling advancements in computer vision tasks such as object detection and image classification. The use of shared weights and spatial hierarchies reduced computational costs and improved generalization, setting the stage for deeper networks."

        "Answer:\n",
        "Role of Residual Connections in ResNet: Residual connections in ResNet (Residual Network) allow the network to learn residual functions by adding the input of a layer to its output, forming \"skip connections.\" This enables the network to learn the difference (residual) between input and output rather than the entire transformation.\n",
        "Addressing the Vanishing Gradient Problem: In deep CNNs, gradients can diminish during backpropagation, slowing or preventing learning. Residual connections mitigate this by providing shortcut paths for gradients to flow directly through the network, ensuring effective training of very deep architectures (e.g., 100+ layers) without degradation in performance."
